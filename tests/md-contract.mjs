// Test helper: a small structural model of a markdown contract document, plus assertions that
// operate on that structure instead of on regexes over the whole body.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// The assertions in `agents.test.mjs` and `skill-contracts.test.mjs` pin what the agent contracts
// and skills *say*, because agents act on that prose. Three rounds of those assertions converged
// on a shape that fails in both directions at once:
//
//   * `assert.match(body, /A[\s\S]{0,150}B/)` — a character-bounded window between two phrases.
//     The window is wide enough to host a whole sentence, so text inserted between A and B that
//     cancels A still matches, and the suite stays green while the contract now says the opposite.
//   * `assert.doesNotMatch(gap, /optional|skip|fine|supported|.../)` — a fixed vocabulary of
//     negations. It catches the phrasing whoever wrote it thought of, and nothing else.
//   * Both break on a reflow, a sentence split, or a backtick change that preserves meaning,
//     because the window is measured in characters of raw markdown.
//
// This module replaces the window with structure: headings -> sections, sections -> blocks
// (paragraph, list item, fenced/indented code), prose blocks -> statements (sentences). An
// assertion can then say "in the section titled X, the paragraph introducing this command block
// states Y, and the only statements in that section about Z are the ones listed" instead of
// "these tokens appear within 150 characters of each other".
//
// WHAT THE ASSERTIONS CAN DETECT
// ------------------------------
//  1. Insertion between a claim and its consequence. `then:` requires the two statements to be
//     *adjacent statements of the same block*. Adjacency is counted in statements, not
//     characters, so any inserted sentence — of any wording, negating or not — breaks it.
//  2. Insertion anywhere in the section that is *about the pinned subject*. `subject:` is a
//     inventory lock, not a denylist: every statement in the section that mentions the subject
//     must be the claim itself or one of the explicitly listed `allow` patterns. A new sentence
//     about that subject fails whatever it says, so no vocabulary of negations is involved.
//  3. Insertion anywhere in the section that cancels a neighbouring instruction *by reference*
//     rather than by naming it ("This rule is obsolete; do it.", "Ignore the step above."). Such
//     a sentence has a nearby instruction as its grammatical subject; a contract section should
//     not contain meta-prose about its own rules, so any of them fails. See BACK_REFERENCE.
//  4. Outright inversion of a claim, because `claim:` must match inside a single statement.
//     Polarity is bound by the sentence boundary; it cannot be satisfied by "never" in one
//     sentence and the asserted verb phrase in another.
//
// WHAT THEY CANNOT DETECT — read this before trusting a green run
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
//  * Contradiction in general. That is a semantic problem and this module does not solve it.
//    A sentence that negates a claim while (a) not naming the pinned subject and (b) not using a
//    recognised back-reference passes. "You may proceed without it." next to a detach requirement
//    is exactly that case: it names nothing and refers to nothing this module recognises.
//  * Back-references outside BACK_REFERENCE. That list is a lexicon and shares the weakness of
//    every lexicon. It is a second, independent net under the subject lock — not a guarantee.
//  * Anything in a *different* section, for a section-scoped assertion. Scope is one section
//    (heading plus its subsections), so a contradiction placed under another heading is out of
//    that assertion's reach by construction. `assertCorpusInventory` is the answer where a claim
//    must not move: it locks every site naming a mechanism across every document at once, so
//    relocation fails like rewording. It buys location, not meaning — its subject pattern is a
//    lexicon with the same weakness as any other, and a sentence that discusses the mechanism
//    without naming it still escapes.
//  * Anything inside a code block. Screens run over prose statements only; code is asserted
//    against explicitly, never scanned for contradictions.
//  * Meaning. `subject:` proves a sentence about the subject was *reviewed by a human writing the
//    test*, not that it agrees with the claim. Adding a pattern to `allow` waives the check for
//    that sentence, and that is the intended cost of adding prose about a pinned subject.
//
// Zero dependencies; Node built-ins only, no markdown library.
