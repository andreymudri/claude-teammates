# Fleet Supervision

## Digest

    node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/cli.mjs" digest --run <runId> --root <project root>

Show that block as-is. It is deliberately compact; do not expand it into prose.

## Event-driven, not polling

Background teammates notify on completion — react to those notifications. The only timer is a
long heartbeat (20-30 minutes) to catch a teammate that hangs and never notifies. Do not sit
in a poll loop.

## Failure handling

| Symptom | Response |
|---|---|
| Result is null (died or skipped) | Mark `orphaned`, never `done`. Offer respawn. |
| Teammate blocked on another task | Missing edge in `plan.json`. Record it, requeue after the blocker. |
| Files touched outside the declared set | Gate failure. Report the stray paths with the owning task. |
| Merge conflict | Escalated by `tm-integrator` with both hunks. Do not resolve semantics yourself. |
| Silent past the heartbeat | Surface it; offer stop or wait. Never assume progress. |

## Scaling suggestions

When queued tasks exceed idle slots, suggest — never silently decide:

> 4 tasks queued, 2 idle slots. Add 2 implementers?

Route the actual spawn through `fleet-lifecycle`.
