// waiting for a notification that never arrives has neither.

// file refreshes an mtime — so it must never be cited as evidence for a gate. It catches the

    //
    // It cannot be called working either, and calling it working was a real defect rather than a
    // theoretical one: on any project whose worktree holds more entries than the walk's cap —
    // a `dist/`, `.next/`, `target/` or `.venv` is enough — every walk floors, every row read
    // working, and the command's only failure signal could never fire on exactly the repositories
    // it exists to supervise. So there are three answers, and the third says so: `unknown` means
    // freshness was NOT measured, which the caller reports rather than dressing up as an
    // all-clear.
    //
    // A fresh TIP still settles the row as working, because that signal was measured and a commit
    // inside the window is proof of work on its own. Only when nothing measured is fresh does the
    // touch signal decide between `unknown` and `stalled`.
    //
    // A capped walk is one of two ways the touch signal goes unmeasured, and the other is the more
    // common: NO touch record at all, because no worktree is registered for the branch. That is
    // absence of evidence, not evidence of absence — a teammate dispatched without worktree
    // isolation, or working in the main worktree, is not observed by this signal at all. Reported
    // as a measured stall it fired the hang alarm on the first heartbeat of such a phase, with
    // every teammate working and simply not having committed yet. A record whose `at` is null is
    // the same answer for the same reason: the walk read nothing, so nothing was measured.
    //
    // A missing TIP is deliberately NOT treated this way. `branchExists` returning false is a
    // measured negative — git is authoritative that nothing has been committed on that ref — so a
    // task with a stale worktree and no branch is a genuine measured stall.
