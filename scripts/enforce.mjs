// Different spellings can name the same ref to git: `refs/heads/main`, `heads/main`
// and `main` are one ref. Strip a leading refs/heads/ or heads/ repeatedly (not just
// once), so a branch whose actual name itself starts with refs/heads/ — whose full ref
// is refs/heads/refs/heads/<name> — still normalizes to the same string as its short
// spelling.
//
// The comparison then folds case. Whether that fold is *necessary* depends on the
// filesystem the check runs on: on a case-insensitive filesystem (Windows, macOS) git
// itself treats `Main` and `main` as one branch, so folding is required there to catch
// a real alias. On a case-sensitive filesystem (Linux, most CI) `main` and `Main` are
// genuinely different branches to git, so the fold can over-trigger — reporting `Main`
// as a violation of the `main` run branch even though git would allow both to exist.
// That over-triggering is deliberate: this is an enforcement check, and only reachable
// by a branch deliberately named against the `teammates/<runId>/<taskId>` convention,
// so failing closed toward "flag it" is the right default in both directions.
//
// This is still a string comparison, not a git query: this module stays pure and has
// no git access, so it cannot resolve either side to a sha. A branch that is the same
// commit as the run branch under a name this normalization does not recognize will not
// be caught here — a sha-based comparison would be strictly correct but needs the git
// wrapper, which lives in the caller, not this predicate.
