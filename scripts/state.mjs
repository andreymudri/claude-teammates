// Worktree location records: `.teammates/index/<sha256 of the normalised worktree>.json`.
//
// NOT YET WIRED UP. As of this commit nothing in the repository calls `writeLocation` or
// `findTaskByWorktree` outside tests: the `locate` command that will write a record and the
// SubagentStop handler that will read one are separate tasks in
// docs/plans/2026-08-13-subagent-stop-enforcement.md and do not exist yet. The comments below
// describe the design those callers are being built to — read every "the hook does X" as "the
// hook is specified to do X", not as a description of running code — and the threat model is
// stated in the present tense because the file format is what it constrains, whoever writes it.
//
// The layout is keyed rather than searched, and that is the whole security argument: a reader
// derives one file name from the path it is asking about and opens it. Nothing enumerates the
// store, so the number of records in it — records are never deleted, and nothing deletes them —
// costs a lookup nothing, and no quantity of files anyone can write changes what a reader does.
// The previous scanning layout had no correct bound: every axis that could be capped (records,
// directories, bytes) was chosen by whoever wrote the files, and the order they were visited in
// was chosen by the filesystem, which also made its tests unportable between NTFS, ext4 and APFS.
//
// KNOWN LIMITATION, by design rather than oversight, and narrower than it first looks: the key
// is the hash of the RESOLVED path, so a record is missed after its worktree is deleted ONLY if
// resolving that path used to change it — a symlinked parent, an 8.3 short name, a case
// difference. For an ordinary path realpath simply throws once the directory is gone,
// `normaliseWorktree` falls back to the lexical form, that form is what was hashed at write
// time, and the record is still found. Where it does miss, the lookup returns null and a hook
// fails open — no enforcement rather than enforcement against the wrong task.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Trailing separators are noise EXCEPT at a filesystem root, where the separator is part of the
// path: stripping it turns `C:\` into the drive-RELATIVE `C:`, which realpath then expands to the
// process's current directory on that drive. A record claiming `worktree: "C:\\"` would otherwise
// match whichever directory the reader happens to be standing in.
// Only the platform's OWN separators: on win32 both `\` and `/` end a path, but on POSIX a
// backslash is an ordinary filename character, so stripping it there would collapse `/a/foo\`
// and `/a/foo` onto one key — two different directories answered by one record, and the
// reader's key-agreement check would recompute the same collapsed form and agree with it.

// Compared, never displayed. One directory has several spellings: what git prints, what the

// and path case on Windows, in trailing separators, and — because a worktree can be reached
// through a symlinked parent (/var vs /private/var) or an 8.3 short name — in the identity of
// the directory components themselves. Trailing separator, case and separator style are folded
// lexically; the rest needs the filesystem, so `resolveLinks` resolves the path through realpath.
//
// That branch is a filesystem call, and its cost is bounded by the filesystem, not by this code:
// realpath on a path that does not exist returns quickly, but on win32 an unreachable UNC share
// blocks the calling thread for as long as the network stack takes to give up — 26.8 s measured
// once on this host, synchronously, with the event loop stopped. It is therefore NOT a cheap
// fallback, and callers holding untrusted paths pass `resolveLinks: false` and decide for
// themselves (see `isLocalAbsolute`).
//
// What remains uncovered even with links resolved: a path that no longer exists at compare time
// falls back to its lexical form and so still fails to match a differently-spelled record, and

// path such as `/net/<host>/wt`, or any autofs or NFS mount point, which is an ordinary absolute

// Round counts are bookkeeping, not enforcement. status.json is written by the agents the

//
// State the bound precisely, because the obvious phrasing is wrong: the gate does NOT read
// nothing under .teammates/ — `gate` and `complete` both read status.json (scripts/cli.mjs:3463
// and :3652). What holds is the half that matters: no forgery here manufactures a PASS. The
// files under .teammates/ are read for bookkeeping, and a corrupt one fails the run CLOSED —
// non-JSON in status.json makes readState rethrow, and gate then reports FAIL with `run-state`
// among the failures and exits 1 even with every check passing. Denial, not escalation.
//
// The worktree location record above is weaker still,
// and not in the way "a teammate can only hurt itself" would suggest: nothing binds a record to
// a writer. Any teammate in the run can write any record, including one naming a DIFFERENT
// teammate's worktree, and newest-wins then resolves that directory to the forged record — so
// the victim is blocked, or judged against a branch that is not its work, while the author of
// the record pays nothing. What that still cannot do is manufacture a PASS: the gate recomputes
// every verdict from git, so the reachable damage is a wrong or missing early catch, never a
// task that ships unverified.
