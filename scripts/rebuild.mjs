// Reconstructing a run's `plan.json` and `status.json` from git and the plan.
//
// `.teammates/` is gitignored, so a clean checkout, a pruned worktree, or a corrupted write loses
// the run's bookkeeping — and until now that was unrecoverable by anything but hand-editing JSON.
// Nothing in the design actually needs those files to be durable: the gate derives the anchor,
// the phase and every verdict from git, `status.gates` has no reader, and `complete` recomputes
// rather than trusting a record. This finishes that property by making the files reproducible.
//
// One thing is deliberately NOT reconstructed. A gate verdict is evidence that checks ran, and
// git carries branches, not evidence. Rebuilding a `gates` entry would manufacture the very
// record the whole design refuses to trust, with the plugin itself as the author. A rebuilt run
// has no gate history, and the honest consequence is that its phases must be gated again.

// `merged` settles the question on its own: once a branch is an ancestor of the run branch its
// own fork-point diff is empty, which says nothing about whether work was done. Before that,
// contributing nothing is the stale-base shape — a ref that exists while the work sits elsewhere
// — and that is `orphaned`, never `done`.
