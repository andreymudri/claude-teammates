// Which of a run's worktrees may be removed, and which may not.
//
// The rule this encodes was written down twice and got followed wrongly both times, because it
// lives in two skills that each state half of it. `parallel-execution` wants a returned
// teammate's worktree gone so a later dispatch can take its branch; `phase-gate` resolves a
// `retry` by RESUMING that same teammate, which fails outright once its worktree is gone —
// taking the task's whole context with it. The reconciliation is: not until the phase has a
// passing gate.
//
// So the phase gate's verdict, not the teammate's return, is what makes a worktree prunable.
// Every refusal is reported with its reason rather than silently skipped: a command that removes
// three of five worktrees and says nothing about the other two reads as a complete job.
//
// Pure. The caller lists the worktrees, names the main one, and supplies the plan's task→phase
// map and the phases that hold a passing gate.

const TASK_BRANCH = /^teammates\/([^/]+)\/([^/]+)$/

// A merge preview is a detached worktree under the system temp directory, named tm-preview-*.
// Its own cleanup runs in a `finally`, which a SIGKILL skips — so these accumulate, and every
// one of them shows up in `doctor` as a worktree the operator never created. They belong to no
// run and hold no branch, so reaping one strands no ref and loses no task context.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS CANNOT TELL, both of which the wording of any report must respect:
//
// 1. The name alone is not evidence. An operator may keep a deliberate detached worktree called
//    tm-preview-notes anywhere on disk. Only location makes it ours, so the temp root is a
//    required input: no temp root means identify NOTHING, never identify everything. The module
//    stays pure — it does not import `node:os` — so the caller supplies the root it observed.
// 2. Liveness is invisible in a worktree list. A gate running in another process RIGHT NOW holds
//    a detached, branchless tm-preview-* worktree indistinguishable from a leaked one. Removing
//    it under the running check fails that gate with missing files rather than a real verdict.
//    No heuristic here can fix that — a mtime or a lock file would be a guess dressed as a fact.
//    So what is identified is: belongs to no run, holds no branch, and is safe to remove ONLY
//    when no gate is running. That last clause is the caller's to satisfy, and the rendered
//    output says so rather than claiming a plain "safe to remove" it cannot verify.
//
//    Liveness therefore arrives as DATA, in `livePreviews`. scripts/merge-preview.mjs writes a
//    `.tm-preview-owner` marker into every preview it creates and removes it in its own
//    `finally`; the caller reads those markers — this module is pure and cannot — and hands in
//    the paths it found a living owner for. Those are excluded from `previews` and reported in
//    `skipped`, never dropped. Supplying nothing keeps the old behaviour exactly: every
//    identified preview is leaked. The set can only ever NARROW what is reaped.
