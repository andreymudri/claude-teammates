// Per-run token reporting: the pure half. Reads nothing and writes nothing, so every rule below
// is testable without touching a real transcript store.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Cache reads dominate a fleet run's token cost — measured at 2,190,488 against
// 212 tokens of fresh input across three agents — and they scale with turns x context, because
// every token in an agent's context is re-read on each later turn. The number that matters is
// therefore not a total but the FIXED PREFIX: the system prompt, agent definition, tool schemas
// and dispatch prompt an agent carries before doing any work. It was 40% of all cache reads, and
// a totals-only report hid it completely: the integrator looked cheapest by cache reads while
// carrying a 5x larger prefix than a reviewer whose prompt was longer.

// The harness's directory name for a project: its absolute path with the separators replaced.
// Both separator kinds are replaced rather than `path.sep` alone, because the answer must not
// depend on which platform is asking about which path.
//
// The COLON is replaced for the same reason and one more: every absolute Windows path carries a
// drive letter, and a colon cannot appear in a Windows filename at all. Leaving it in produced a
// slug like `D:-fake-project`, naming a directory that can never exist there — so the lookup
