// Assembling the `gate --results` file out of the findings files reviewers drop.
//
// The returned response stays the interface: a reviewer writes its findings file and returns the
// same JSON, and the orchestrator reads the response first. This module covers the case that
// motivated the file at all — a reviewer that goes idle without emitting, taking a completed
// review with it. What it produces is caller input to the gate, never a verdict: `aggregateVerdict`
// still computes that, and `--results` still refuses computed check kinds.
//
// One rule shapes everything here: a lens with no file is a review that was LOST, which is a
// different fact from a review that found nothing. Collecting it as an empty pass would hand the
// gate the vacuous PASS that leaving the check `pending` exists to prevent. A lens whose file
// says it could not verify anything is the same fact arriving by a different route, and takes the
// same route out.

// Values read out of an agent-written file end up in sentences an operator reads in a terminal
// and another agent reads in a transcript. A terminal ACTS on control bytes: a value carrying
// `ESC [ 2 K` `CR` erases the line that was just drawn and writes its own over it, so a refusal
// this CLI printed can be redrawn as a passing gate. A reviewer demonstrated exactly that against
// `collect-reviews` with a `stamp.lens` carrying that sequence.
//
// So every such value is passed through one of these two before it is printed. They replace the
// dangerous bytes with a visible `<0x1B>` token: the value stays readable, and nothing in it is
// still an instruction to the terminal.
//
// The C1 range (0x80–0x9F) goes with the C0 range because a terminal in an 8-bit mode reads 0x9B
// as CSI directly, with no ESC in front of it — an assertion that only looks for 0x1B would pass
// over that.

// Reviewer findings describe a diff, and a diff is only identified by the branch tips it was

// that stamps before it reads anything — can `git rev-parse` the current tips, emit `{findings:
// [], stamp: {...}}`, and pass `reviewStale` while having judged nothing. What the stamp rules
// out is a *stale* file surviving into a round it was never written for; it does not rule out a
// *fabricated* one, because the reviewer computed the very tips it is graded against. This is not
// a regression — an unstamped file passed the same collection with the same blind trust before

// Reading a wrong-typed value as a report would refuse `unableToVerify: []` — a reviewer that did
// full work and wrote an empty list — and send the operator to respawn a review that already
// happened. Reading it as absent would collect `unableToVerify: true` as a clean pass, the exact
// vacuous PASS this route exists to remove, and would silently drop `unprobed: 32` — a reviewer
// that counted rather than listed — so a review that reached a fifth of its claims would emit no
// bounded note and read as exhaustive. So the shape is reported instead, and the fix is to the

// a findings file that exists and cannot be parsed is not an empty review.
